"""
You are at the side of a river. You are given a m litre jug and a n litre jug where 0 < m < n. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs donâ€™t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d litres of water where d < n. Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain d litres of water in one of jug.
The operations you can perform are:
    Empty a Jug
    Fill a Jug
    Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full.

Input:
First line consists of T test cases. Only line of every test case consists of 3 spaced integers denoting m , n, and d respectively. 

Output:
Single line output, print the minimum number of operations.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N,D<=100
1<=M<=N

Example:
Input:
2
8 56 46
3 5 4
Output:
-1
6


input:

1 5 4
3 2 1

output:

3 5 4

output:
6

Explanation:
(0,0)->(3,0)->(0,3)->(3,3)->(1,5)->(1,0)->(0,1)->(3,1)->(0,4)
Hence the no of operations you need to perform are 8.

input:

5 2 1
10 4 3

output:
4
-1

input:
1
10 2 1

output:
-1

hint:
Fill the m litre jug and empty it into n liter jug.Whenever the m liter jug becomes empty fill it.Whenever the n liter jug becomes full empty it.
Repeat steps 1,2,3 till either n liter jug or the m liter jug contains d litres of water.
