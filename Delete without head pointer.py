"""
You are given a pointer/ reference to the node which is to be deleted from the linked list of N nodes. The task is to delete the node. Pointer/ reference to head node is not given. 
Note: No head reference is given to you.

input:
The first line contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,â€¦,AN.
The third line Contains a single integer node.

output:
Print the list after remaining nodes.

input:
2
1 2
1

output:
2

Explanation:
After deleting 1 from the linked list, we have remaining nodes as 2.

input:
4
10 20 4 30
20

output:
10 4 30

input:
5
1 0 55 54 10
0

output:
1 55 54 10

input:
5
12 12 10 11 13
12

output:
12 10 11 13

input:
4
1 0 1 1
1

output:
0 1 1
hint:
Traverse the linked list until you find the node you want to delete. But this solution requires pointer to the head node which contradicts the problem statement.
